for this code I'm following the tutorial: https://hevodata.com/learn/building-a-secure-node-js-rest-api/

step 1:
    basic project creation:
    //src/index.js
    //package.json
    //notes.txt         *this file

step 2:
    installed dependecy packages:
        `npm install body-parser cors express helmet morgan`

    in the indexjs file:
        initialized the express application
        added a simple in memory array to mock a datastore
        configured dependecies
        created a single GET endpoint

step 3:
    the tutorial starts to use mongoose wich is a mongo db ODM system,
    but I don't like going that way.
    I would like to explore how can i define the api endpoints with express
    first

    dsicontinuing the tutorial.

I'm startig to inquire about nodejs express module
an interesting tutorial about routing: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html
